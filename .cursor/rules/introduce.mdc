---

## 3. Development Guidelines

### 3-1. Markup & Structure

- Use semantic HTML tags (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<figure>`, etc.)
- Design reusable components and a common layout structure.

### 3-2. Image Handling

- Do **not** use `next/image`.
- Use the standard `<img>` tag.

### 3-3. Layout & Responsiveness

- Support only screen sizes **1280px and above**.
- Do not implement unnecessary responsive layouts.

### 3-4. Code Writing Principles

- Implement **only** what is specified in this guideline.
- Do not add features or styles arbitrarily.
- Always understand and verify your own code and output.
- **Analyze existing codebase patterns** and follow the same style and structure.
- **Always include comments explaining Why / What / How for your code.**

```ts
// Why: Why is this code necessary?
// What: What does this code implement?
// How: How is this code implemented?
```

3-5. Responsibility

The full responsibility for structure, implementation, and documentation lies entirely with the guideline author.

Junior developers must strictly follow the guideline and hold no responsibility for the outcome.

4. Quality Verification

Browser testing: Check on Chrome, Safari, and Edge.

Accessibility check: Ensure basic alt text, keyboard navigation, and contrast ratio.

5. Documentation

Each directory must include a README.md containing:

Project overview

Directory structure

Key rules summary

Always read the corresponding README before starting code work.
